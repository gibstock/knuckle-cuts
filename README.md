# knuckle-cuts
This is the beginning steps to further my understanding of all things code.
I intend to use this repository to hold my personal portfolio website. I will be using simple HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Then I will deploy to Netlify with a personal domain. 
I hope to learn as I Blog my progress.
